# 2021-Citadel-Datathon
Host for the 2nd place winner of Citadel 2021 DataOpen Summer Invitational

The datathon runs for one week. The prompt of the datathon is to broadly investigate the impact of Airbnb rental activities in U.S. cities. Our submission focused on the economic impacts of Airbnb on southern U.S. cities. The main technique used in the paper is a two-stage fixed effects regression with LASSO-constructed instrumental variables. 

We took the second place in the competition and won a prize of $10000. Thank you Citadel for hosting this amazing event!
